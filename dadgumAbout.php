<center><h2>About Dad Gum Salsa</h2></center>
<p>This is some text that is placed in the transparent box.
I've been making salsa for quite some time now, working on 
perfecting my recipes and discovering new types of salsa too. 
Ever since I returned from Alaska, I've been trying to think 
of what I would really love to do. The one thing I know for 
certain, is my love for salsa, it's a passion, 
I could do it everyday happily!
